## HiðŸ‘‹! Adeyemi Tomiwa
|Data Engineer|design and implementing scalable data pipelines

## MissionðŸŽ¯
Build scalable, reliable data pipelines that turn raw data into clean, actionable insights. I focus on automation, cloud-native tools (Python, SQL, AWS), and data integrity to support real-time and batch processing. Iâ€™m driven by continuous learning and delivering solutions that create real business value.

## About Me
Iâ€™m a Data Engineer who loves turning messy, complex data into clean, reliable systems that actually make sense. I build pipelines that scale, automate the boring stuff, and make data trustworthy from end to end. Whether itâ€™s Python scripts, SQL tuning, or cloud tools like AWS, I enjoy solving real problems with smart, efficient solutions.

Iâ€™m curious by nature and always looking to improve how data flows and supports decisions. For me, data engineering isnâ€™t just technical work, itâ€™s about creating clarity and making things easier for everyone who relies on data.

Driven by resilence,curiosity, and a desire to be a better version of myself, i continue to grow, share, and lead with purpose.
